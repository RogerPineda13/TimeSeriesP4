This repo is to show our inner working with Time Series Modeling


# Overview
This project uses Time Series Analysis and Time Series Modeling to accurately predict the current/future stock price of pre-selected companies. The purpose for this time series model is so that we can advise our investors when to put their money into the market.

We will be focusing on data collected from January 2006 until January 2018. This dataset is consistent of entries when the stock market is open
