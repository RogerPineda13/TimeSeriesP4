# TimeSeriesP4
This repo is to show our inner working with Time Series Modeling


# Overview
This project uses Time Series Analysis and Time Series Modeling to accurately predict the current/future stock price of pre-selected companies. The purpose for this time series model is so that we can advise our investors when to put their money into the market.

We will be focusing on data collected from January 2006 until January 2018. This dataset is consistent of entries when the stock market is open


# Business Understanding & Key Questions
The ever wanting answer to everyone who wants to turn their money into more money is when is the right time to invest my money into the stock market. Timing is crucial when it comes to stocks and investing. Putting in your money when the market is reaching a peak and will only go down could cost you your life savings. Taking your money out too early could make you miss out on capital gains that could finance the start of a new journey. You as a future investor could possibly use our model to find out the future price of a stock.  


* Is it possible to predict future stock prices by just looking at the past?
* How significant is looking at the closing price for a stock for the day play into the future price?
